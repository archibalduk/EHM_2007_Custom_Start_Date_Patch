# EHM 2007 Custom Start Date Patch
Initially released in 2011, the Custom Start Date Patch (CSD Patch) allows you to change the starting year/season in Eastside Hockey Manager 2007. This patch does not make any changes to the ehm2007.exe file or any other files on your computer. Similar to other cheat/memory utilities, the CSD Patch alters some of the temporary data stored in your computer's RAM whilst EHM is running. By making these changes, it tricks EHM into using a year of your choice when starting a new game.

The CSD Patch was last compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio 2013.

Please bear in mind that this is the first ever C++ code I wrote and it was a big learning curve. The standard of coding is very poor and should ideally be re-organised. However, the code is very short and simple, so it should only take an hour or two to tidy things up.
